I will send you a document containing your introduction and project details 5 minutes before the interview to your Gmail. If you prefer, you may use your own version, but ensure it includes all relevant business terms and project details.

I will also provide an **Otter link** for backup transcription before 5 min of the call, but please note Otter is only 80-90% accurate. It’s best to focus on the voice and use Otter sparingly. For coding or screen sharing, close Otter on your laptop and keep it open on your mobile device.

Also Please open otter on mobile and put that infront of your screen otr some latop or ipad whihc you can keep behind your laptop.

## Interview Etiquette:

- Speak slowly and clearly, matching your pace with mine.
- If the interviewer asks you to remove earphones, rely on Otter for transcription.
- When screen sharing, share only the browser window, not your entire screen (unless specifically requested).
- Make sure your camera is properly visible and you are sitting in good posture.
- Make your audio is clerly audiable to me as per given instructions.
- Do not use external  monitors as they might be confusing.
- Close all other unrealed apps which is not required.
- Prefrebarly use chrome for your calls and alwats use app instead of browser. Test the app before call.

## Tips:

- If you face any issues with Otter or audio, politely inform the interviewer and request to rejoin the call after resolving the issue with me , please do speak randomly.
- If you think your interview might got extented so please book 30 min buffer time because last moment i won't be able to extend as i do have back to back calls.
- Ensure you receive confirmation from the recruiter or vendor then only book the slot.
- Minium booking time is 30 minutes.
- If you anticipate needing extra time in interview or it might extend, I suggest booking an additional 30 minutes in advance.
- Also please try to book your call for complete hour means like 9,10,11,12 rather then 9:30 , 10:30 . In case of non complete hour 30 min charges would be extra.
- Also even if interviwer is trying to extend the call then just give him a headsup before 5 min that you have another call to won't be abel to extend.
- I do not provide previous Otter links due to confidentiality, but you can practice with YouTube captions.
